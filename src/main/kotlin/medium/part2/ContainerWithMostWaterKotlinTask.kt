/**
 * You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the
 * ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that
 * the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
 * Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water
 * (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: height = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
